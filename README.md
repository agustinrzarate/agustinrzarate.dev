## 📋 About Me

Frontend developer with 5 years of experience building scalable and efficient solutions for various companies. I specialize in performance, interface design, and frontend architecture. I have also led teams, achieving excellent results in both product delivery and technical training. My strongest qualities are adaptability, persistence, and dedication. In my free time, I study markets, trade, and lift weights.

### Over the years:

I've built products for companies related to the fintech world such as virtual wallets and financial solutions to design and optimize financial products.

I also took part in Intel Partner Marketing Studio, a global platform for managing digital marketing resources, where I led significant refactors, migrated from JavaScript to TypeScript, and improved scalability and maintainability.

At GOIAR I was selected by my peers as one of three leaders of the frontend community. In that role, we coordinated and delivered internal training sessions on hexagonal architecture, clean architecture, frontend design patterns, and criteria for selecting technologies based on the context of each project.
